### What Is __Chime In__?

__Chime In__ is a safe and fun way to communicate and give feedaback via Microsoft Teams while riding a bike.

As a cyclist, you can keep up with your Teams channels without missing a ride. You could approve a project whilst you bike commute.

As a manager, you'll get immediate feedback on your communications - imagine the flurry of thumbs-ups when you announce your latest idea.

This not only makes everyone more efficient, it encourages us all to have fun and stay healthy.

__Chime In__ is powered by __Azure__ & __Microsoft 365__ and it looks great on mobile and desktop.
